No Conditional Access available

If you do not have P1 and no CA, you cannot do identity-layer IP blocks in Entra.

Your containment becomes:

Aggressive for impacted users (password reset + revoke sessions)

Tighten account lockout and smart lockout settings (limited control)

Disable legacy auth wherever possible

Turn on Security Defaults if you can accept the impact
